  <h1 class="heading-odd">Engineering Honors Executive Committee (ExCom)</h1>
  <p class="text-odd">
    I chose to give back to the
    <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/academics/eh/index.html" target="_blank">Engineering Honors (EH)</a>
    program by volunteering my time and talent to ExCom as an Operations member.
    I volunteer for the EH program because I want EH
    students to have the same wonderful experience I have (and am having!).
    Check out the <a href="https://hdhulipala02.github.io/ExCom/" target="_blank">website</a> that I helped
    make for ExCom. More improvements coming soon!

  <p class="text-even">
    Just recently, I joined the cat foster program for the
    <a href="https://aggielandhumane.org/our-story/" target="_blank">Aggieland Humane Society</a> 
    so that shelter cats can have a safe and secure temporary home.
    Come say hi to my furry friend when I receive one :)

  <h1 class="heading-odd">STEM Education</h1>
  <p class="text-odd">
    Sometime in the future, I plan on teaching STEM topics in elementary/high schools
    to students that need the best education they deserve. I enjoy teaching and I am a firm
    believer that teaching is the best way of learning!
