      <p class="portfolio-item-text">
        <a href="https://github.com/johndpjr/AgTern" target="_blank">AgTern</a> is an ongoing project that I'm leading
        as a Project Manager for the <a href="https://aggiecodingclub.com/" target="_blank">Aggie Coding Club</a>.
        This web service is built by and for Texas A&M students.
        Its goal is to help students find relevant internships and relieve the stress of applications.
        I lead my team with an Agile framework and have learned
        so many valuable lessons about project management along the way. Ask me about the
        challenges we faced and the mistakes we made and what we learned as a result!

      <p class="portfolio-item-text">
        <a href="https://github.com/johndpjr/PeachOS" target="_blank">PeachOS</a> is a 32-bit operating system (OS)
        written in C that I developed alongside a
        <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/developing-a-multithreaded-kernel-from-scratch/" target="_blank">Udemy course</a>
        that taught building a multi-tasking OS from scratch.
        Having written over 3.5k lines of code and watching 27 hours of video content, I learned so much about
        systems programming and managing software complexity.

      <p class="portfolio-item-text">
        <a href="https://github.com/johndpjr/clocker" target="_blank">Clocker</a> is a Command Line Interface (CLI)
        written in Python that tracks your work hours. During my last internship, I needed a good
        way to track my hours for the day, so I created this application to track clocking
        in and out of work and lunch. I love applying software solutions to real needs!
