  <h1 class="heading-odd">Skills</h1>
  <h2 class="heading-odd">Proficiency</h2>
  <ul class="list text-odd">
    <li>
      <b>Python</b>: As my first programming language, Python holds a special place in my heart.
      In my earlier years, I just simply enjoyed tinkering with all the neat
      things Python could do (I still tinker!). Over the years, I've gathered lots of experience
      with the many features and libraries that Python provides: from
      <a href="https://github.com/johndpjr/Journaly" target="_blank">constructing GUIs</a>
      with tkinter to setting up low-latency API endpoints with FastAPI, I've done a lot!
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>C/C++</b>: Ah... the old bread and butter of systems programming. I started self-learning
      C++ and greatly enjoyed the greater control of the hardware that these compiled
      programming languages offered over the interpreted Python code. Check out my
      (not finished) <a href="https://github.com/johndpjr/8080_Emulator" target="_blank">8080 emulator</a> project!
      With these languages, I learned a very important lesson: with great power comes great responsibility.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Java</b>: Enough said...
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="heading-odd">Familiarity</h2>
  <ul class="list text-odd">
    <li>
      <b>TypeScript & JavaScript</b>: At least TypeScript's name actually makes sense!
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Scheme</b>: The 1970's called- they want their programming language back...
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h1 class="heading-even">Areas of Interest</h1>
  <ul class="list text-even">
    <li>
      <b>Systems Programming</b>: This kind of programming is right where I'd like to be!
      Being that bridge between the hardware and the software is becoming an increasingly
      important space in the world of computers, especially as hardware becomes more advanced
      and the software demands get larger.
      I enjoy low level enough to be interfacing with the OS (or being the OS!)
      and high level enough so that I can interface with existing libraries (and implement my own!).
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</b>: Take a look at my <a href="ai.html">A.I.</a> page if you're
      not convinced that AI is a force to be reckoned with! Please check it out anyway- it's really
      cool what ChatGPT can do nowadays! But seriously, AI has always been a topic that has
      piqued my curiousity and challenged me to think about the implications of such technologies
      and our role as software engineers to inform the public in an objective and truthful manner.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Compiler Design</b>: Compiling source code to machine code is a hard task!
      Not only do you need to rigourously analyze the source code to identify tokens
      and parse to understand its meaning,
      but you need a deep understanding of the underlying data structures
      and algorithms of compilers.
      I've always been up to a good challenge, however. That's why one of my goals
      in the next few years is create a toy C compiler that can handle most vanilla C code.
      Please root for me!
